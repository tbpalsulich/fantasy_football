Fantasy Football
================

This repo contains some Ruby helper scripts to parse NFL.com stats. Ideally, this will be used
to plug in a new fantasy season's rules and get back their total points (in the new system) for
last year (or any other year) and projected this year.

This is still under development. So, any and all pull and feature requests are welcome!

### Goals
 - [ ] Plug in fantasy rules, get back total points for last season
 - [ ] Correlate injury rates with various statistics
 - [ ] Plot trends over time for various stats for players
 - [ ] Convert into an RoR project
