Fantasy Football
================

This repo contains some Ruby helper scripts to parse NFL.com stats. Ideally, this will be used
to plug in a new fantasy season's rules and get back each player's new total points for any
previous year and/or projected this year.

This project is still under development. So, any and all pull and feature requests are welcome!

### Possible project goals
 - [ ] Plug in fantasy rules, get back total points for last season
 - [ ] Correlate injury rates with various statistics
 - [ ] Plot trends over time for various stats for players
 - [ ] Convert into an RoR project
